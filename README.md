# FPGA Basic Calculator - Basys 3

## Description:

This project implements a basic calculator on the Basys 3 FPGA board using SystemVerilog and Xilinx Vivado.
The calculator can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations on two 4-digit numbers.
The user inputs the numbers using the board's switches, and the results are displayed on the LEDs.


## Features:

1. Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of 4-digit numbers.
2. User-friendly input through Basys 3 switches.
3. Output displayed on the Basys 3 LEDs.

## Technologies Used:
1. SystemVerilog for hardware description.
2. Xilinx Vivado for FPGA synthesis and implementation.
