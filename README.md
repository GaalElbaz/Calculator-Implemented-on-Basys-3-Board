# Calculator-Implemented-on-Basys-3-Board
FPGA Basic Calculator - Basys 3
Description:

This project implements a basic calculator on the Basys 3 FPGA board using SystemVerilog and Xilinx Vivado. The calculator can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations on two 4-digit numbers. The user inputs the numbers using the board's switches, and the results are displayed on the LEDs.

Features:

Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of 4-digit numbers.
User-friendly input through Basys 3 switches.
Output displayed on the Basys 3 LEDs.
Technologies Used:

SystemVerilog for hardware description.
Xilinx Vivado for FPGA synthesis and implementation.
